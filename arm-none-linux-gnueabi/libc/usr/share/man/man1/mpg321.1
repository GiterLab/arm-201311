.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
\fBmpg321\fR is a free command-line mp3 player, 
which uses the mad audio decoding library. mpg321 was written to be a  
drop-in replacement for the (by-then) non-free \fBmpg123\fR player. 
Some functions remain unimplemented, but mpg321 should function as a 
basic drop-in replacement for \fBmpg123\fR front-ends such as  
\fBgqmpeg\fR, and those programs which use mpg123 to decode 
mp3 files (like \fBgtoaster\fR, and other CD-recording  
software). 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.IP "\fB-o devicetype\fP         " 10 
Set the output device type to \fBdevicetype\fP.  
\fBdevicetype\fP can be one of: 
.IP "" 10 
oss \- the Linux Open Sound System; 
.IP "" 10 
sun \- the Sun audio system; 
.IP "" 10 
alsa \- the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture; 
.IP "" 10 
alsa09 \- the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture, version 0.9; 
.IP "" 10 
esd \- the Enlightened Sound Daemon; 
.IP "" 10 
arts \- the analog real-time synthesiser  
.IP "" 10 
See \fB-a device\fP, below. 
.IP "\fB-a device\fP, \fB\-\-audiodevice device\fP" 10 
Use \fBdevice\fP for audio-out instead of the default device,  
depending on the output device you've chosen (via \fB-o devicetype\fP). 
By default this is the native sound device. 
Generally this is the device for \fBdevicetype\fP  
(or the default system device) to use for output (i.e. \fB/dev/sound/dsp1\fP). 
 
.IP "" 10 
This option has no effect with \fB-o arts\fP. 
.IP "" 10 
For \fB-o esd\fP, specify the host on which esd is running; defaults to localhost.  
.IP "" 10 
For \fB-o alsa\fP, specify audio device using the hw:x,y syntax, where x and y are numbers, default is hw:0,0. 
For example, if there is only one device installed, in most cases, the device should be named hw:0,0.  
When there is only one device, the device should always have the same name and numbers. 
.IP "\fB-g N\fP, \fB\-\-gain N\fP         " 10 
Set gain (volume) to N (1-100). 
.IP "\fB-k N\fP, \fB\-\-skip N\fP         " 10 
Skip N frames into the file being played. 
.IP "\fB-n N\fP, \fB\-\-frames N\fP         " 10 
Decode only the first N frames of the stream. By default, the entire stream is decoded. 
.IP "\fB-@ list\fP, \fB\-\-list list\fP         " 10 
Use the file list for a playlist. The list should be in a format of filenames followed by a line feed. Multiple \-@ or \-\-list specifiers will be ignored; only the last \-@ or \-\-list option will be used. The playlist is concatenated with filenames specified on the command-line to produce one master playlist. A filename of '\-' will cause standard input to be read as a playlist. 
 
.IP "\fB-z\fP, \fB\-\-shuffle\fP" 10 
Shuffle playlists and files specified on the command-line. Produces a randomly-sorted playlist which is then played through once. 
.IP "\fB-Z\fP, \fB\-\-random\fP" 10 
Randomise playlists and files specified on the command-line. Files are played through, choosing at random; this means that random files will be played for as long as mpg321 is running. 
.IP "\fB-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP         " 10 
Be more verbose. Show current byte, bytes remaining, time, and time remaining, as well as more information about the mp3 file. 
.IP "\fB-s\fP, \fB\-\-stdout\fP         " 10 
Use standard output instead of an audio device for output. Output is in 16-bit PCM, little-endian. 
.IP "\fB-w N\fP, \fB\-\-wav N\fP         " 10 
Write to wav file N instead of using the audio device. This option will be preferred if \-\-cdr or \-\-au are specified too. Specifying '\-' for N will cause the file to be written to standard output. 
.IP "\fB\-\-cdr N\fP         " 10 
Write to cdr file N instead of using the audio device. Specifying '\-' for N will cause the file to be written to standard output. 
.IP "\fB\-\-au N\fP         " 10 
Write to au file N instead of using the audio device. Specifying '\-' for N will cause the file to be written to standard output. 
.IP "\fB-t\fP, \fB\-\-test\fP         " 10 
Test mode; do no output at all. 
 
.IP "\fB-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP         " 10 
Quiet mode; suppress output of mpg123 boilerplate and file and song name. 
 
.IP "\fB-B\fP         " 10 
Read recursively the given directories. Allows you to define only the directory or directories and then mpg321 recursively plays all the songs. 
 
.IP "\fB-F\fP         " 10 
Turn on FFT analysis on PCM data. Remote mode only 
 
.IP "\fB-S\fP         " 10 
Report song to AudioScrobbler (last.fm). 
 
.IP "\fB-x\fP         " 10 
Set xterm title setting 
 
.IP "\fB-b\fP         " 10 
Number of decoded frames for the output buffer. 
 
.IP "\fB-K\fP         " 10 
Enable Basic Keys. 
 
.IP "\fB-R\fP         " 10 
"Remote control" mode. Useful for front-ends. Allows seeking and pausing of mp3 files. See README.remote (in /usr/share/doc/mpg321 on Debian and some other systems.) 
 
.IP "\fB-3\fP, \fB\-\-restart\fP         " 10 
Restart "remote shell". Used only when in "Remote control" mode. 
.IP "\fB\-\-stereo\fP         " 10 
Force stereo output: duplicates mono stream on second output channel. Useful for output for devices that don't understand mono, such as some CD players. 
 
.IP "\fB\-\-aggressive\fP         " 10 
Aggressive mode; try to get higher priority on the system. Needs root permissions. 
 
.IP "\fB\-\-skip-printing-frames=N\fP         " 10 
Skip N frames between printing a frame status update, in both Remote Control (\-R) and verbose (\-v) mode. Can help CPU utilisation on slower machines. This is an mpg321-specific option. 
 
.IP "\fB-l N\fP, \fB\-\-loop N\fP         " 10 
Loop song or playlist N times.If N is 0 means infinite times. 
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fP, \fB\-\-longhelp\fP         " 10 
Show summary of options. 
.IP "\fB-V\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP         " 10 
Show version of program. 
.SH "Basic keys: " 
.IP "\fB * or / \fP  " 10 
Increase or decrease volume. 
.IP "\fB n \fP  " 10 
Skip song. 
.IP "\fB m \fP  " 10 
Mute/unmute.
