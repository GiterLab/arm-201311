\-The seeking semantics of the \-Ogg file format were outlined by \-Monty in {\tt a post to theora-\/dev} in \-September 2002. \-Quoting from that post, we have the following assumptions\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \-Ogg is not a non-\/linear format. ... \-It is a media transport format designed to do nothing more than deliver content, in a stream, and have all the pieces arrive on time and in sync.
\item \-The \-Ogg layer does not know the specifics of the codec data it's multiplexing into a stream. \-It knows nothing beyond '\-Oooo, packets!', that the packets belong to different buckets, that the packets go in order, and that packets have position markers. \-Ogg does not even have a concept of 'time'; it only knows about the sequentially increasing, unitless position markers. \-It is up to higher layers which have access to the codec \-A\-P\-Is to assign and convert units of framing or time.
\end{DoxyItemize}

(\-For more details on the structure of \-Ogg streams, see the \doxyref{\-Ogg \-Basics }{p.}{group__basics} section).

\-For data such as media, for which it is possible to provide a mapping such as 'time', \-Oggz can efficiently navigate through an \-Ogg stream by use of an \-Oggz\-Metric callback, thus allowing automatic seeking to points in 'time'.

\-For common codecs you can ask \-Oggz to set this for you automatically by instantiating the \-O\-G\-G\-Z handle with the \-O\-G\-G\-Z\-\_\-\-A\-U\-T\-O flag set. \-For others you can specify a multiplier with \doxyref{oggz\-\_\-set\-\_\-metric\-\_\-linear()}{p.}{oggz__deprecated_8h_a12f232bca448853e66a1226ddccff7e0}, or a generic non-\/linear metric with \doxyref{oggz\-\_\-set\-\_\-metric()}{p.}{group__metric_ga5a630e8dcd04e1dd6601d8f56f0af3f6}.
