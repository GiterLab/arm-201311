\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-Architecture-\/dependent type for oggz\-\_\-off\-\_\-t. \-This file should never be included directly by user code. \-Please include either of $<$\doxyref{oggz/oggz.\-h}{p.}{oggz_8h}$>$ or $<$\doxyref{oggz/oggz\-\_\-off\-\_\-t.\-h}{p.}{oggz__off__t_8h}$>$ instead.

\-This file was generated when liboggz was built.

\-Note that this file is only generated when using \-G\-N\-U autoconf. \-This file is not used on \-Win32 systems.

\-This typedef was determined on the system on which the documentation was generated. 

\-To query this on your system, do eg.


\begin{DoxyPre}
   echo "gcc -E \doxyref{oggz.h}{p.}{oggz_8h} | grep oggz\_off\_t
 \end{DoxyPre}
