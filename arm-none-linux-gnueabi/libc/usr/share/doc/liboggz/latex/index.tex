\section{\-Oggz makes programming with Ogg easy!}\label{index_intro}
\-This is the documentation for the \-Oggz \-C \-A\-P\-I. \-Oggz provides a simple programming interface for reading and writing \-Ogg files and streams. \-Ogg is an interleaving data container developed by \-Monty at {\tt \-Xiph.\-Org}, originally to support the \-Ogg \-Vorbis audio format.

liboggz supports the flexibility afforded by the \-Ogg file format while presenting the following \-A\-P\-I niceties\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \-Strict adherence to the formatting requirements of \-Ogg \doxyref{bitstreams }{p.}{group__basics}, to ensure that only valid bitstreams are generated
\item \-A simple, callback based open/read/close or open/write/close \doxyref{interface }{p.}{oggz_8h} to raw \-Ogg files
\item \-A customisable \doxyref{seeking }{p.}{group__seek__api} abstraction for seeking on multitrack \-Ogg data
\item \-A packet queue for feeding incoming packets for writing, with callback based notification when this queue is empty
\item \-A means of overriding the \doxyref{\-I\-O functions }{p.}{oggz__io_8h} used by \-Oggz, for easier integration with media frameworks and similar systems.
\item \-A handy \doxyref{table }{p.}{oggz__table_8h} structure for storing information on each logical bitstream
