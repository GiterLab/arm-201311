\section{\-Fish\-Sound, the sound of fish!}\label{index_intro}
\-This is the documentation for the \-Fish\-Sound \-C \-A\-P\-I. \-Fish\-Sound provides a simple programming interface for decoding and encoding audio data using \-Xiph.\-Org codecs (\-F\-L\-A\-C, \-Speex and \-Vorbis).

libfishsound by itself is designed to handle raw codec streams from a lower level layer such as \-U\-D\-P datagrams. \-When these codecs are used in files, they are commonly encapsulated in {\tt \-Ogg} to produce {\itshape \-Ogg \-F\-L\-A\-C\/}, {\itshape \-Speex\/} and {\itshape \-Ogg \-Vorbis\/} files. \-Example \-C programs using {\tt liboggz} to read and write these files are provided in the libfishsound sources.

\-For more information on the design and history of libfishsound, see the \doxyref{\-About }{p.}{group__about} section of this documentation, and the {\tt libfishsound} homepage.\subsection{\-Contents}\label{index_contents}
