\-To decode audio data using libfishsound\-:  


\-To decode audio data using libfishsound\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item create a \-Fish\-Sound$\ast$ object with mode \-F\-I\-S\-H\-\_\-\-S\-O\-U\-N\-D\-\_\-\-D\-E\-C\-O\-D\-E. \doxyref{fish\-\_\-sound\-\_\-new()}{p.}{fishsound_8h_adecddfef35cbbddcc8a76b28c365c527} will return a new \-Fish\-Sound$\ast$ object, initialised for decoding, and the \doxyref{\-Fish\-Sound\-Info}{p.}{structFishSoundInfo} structure will be cleared.
\item provide a \-Fish\-Sound\-Decoded\-\_\-$\ast$ callback for libfishsound to call when it has decoded audio.
\item (optionally) specify whether you want to receive interleaved or per-\/channel \-P\-C\-M data, using a \doxyref{fish\-\_\-sound\-\_\-set\-\_\-interleave()}{p.}{deprecated_8h_a8e6b76134675d948015fe4afa3fe4104}. \-The default is for per-\/channel (non-\/interleaved) \-P\-C\-M.
\item feed encoded audio data to libfishsound via \doxyref{fish\-\_\-sound\-\_\-decode()}{p.}{decode_8h_a070a1843d6990a00e2471945d40645c7}. libfishsound will decode the audio for you, calling the \-Fish\-Sound\-Decoded\-\_\-$\ast$ callback you provided earlier each time it has a block of audio ready.
\item when finished, call \doxyref{fish\-\_\-sound\-\_\-delete()}{p.}{fishsound_8h_a002e2dee1a7f736699dba5bec0a81426}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\-This procedure is illustrated in src/examples/fishsound-\/decode.\-c. \-Note that this example additionally\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item uses {\tt liboggz} to demultiplex audio data from an \-Ogg encapsulated \-F\-L\-A\-C, \-Speex or \-Vorbis stream. \-The step of feeding encoded data to libfishsound is done within the \-Oggz\-Read\-Packet callback.
\item uses {\tt libsndfile} to write the decoded audio to a \-W\-A\-V file.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\-Hence this example code demonstrates all that is needed to decode \-Ogg \-F\-L\-A\-C, \-Speex or \-Ogg \-Vorbis files\-:
