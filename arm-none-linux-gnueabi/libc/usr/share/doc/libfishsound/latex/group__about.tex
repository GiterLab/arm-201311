\subsection{\-Design}\label{group__about_design}
libfishsound provides a simple programming interface for decoding and encoding audio data using codecs from {\tt \-Xiph.\-Org}.

libfishsound by itself is designed to handle raw codec streams from a lower level layer such as \-U\-D\-P datagrams. \-When these codecs are used in files, they are commonly encapsulated in {\tt \-Ogg} to produce {\itshape \-Ogg \-F\-L\-A\-C\/}, {\itshape \-Speex\/} and {\itshape \-Ogg \-Vorbis\/} files. \-Example \-C programs using {\tt liboggz} to read and write these files are provided in the libfishsound sources.

libfishsound is implemented as a wrapper around the existing codec libraries and provides a consistent, higher-\/level programming interface. \-The motivation for this is twofold\-: to simplify the task of developing application software that supports these codecs, and to ensure that valid codec streams are generated.\subsection{\-History}\label{group__about_history}
libfishsound was designed and developed by \-Conrad \-Parker on the weekend of \-October 18-\/19 2003. \-Previously the author had implemented \-Vorbis and \-Speex support in the following software\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\tt \-Sweep}, a digital audio editor with decoding and \-G\-U\-I control of all encoding options of \-Vorbis and \-Speex
\item \-Speex support in the {\tt xine} multimedia player
\item \-Vorbis and \-Speex importers for {\tt libannodex}, the basic library for reading and writing {\tt \-Annodex.\-net} media files.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\-The implementation of libfishsound draws heavily on these sources, and in turn the original example sources of libvorbis and libvorbisenc by \-Monty, and libspeex by \-Jean-\/\-Marc \-Valin.

\-The naming of libfishsound reflects both the \-Xiph.\-Org logo and the author's reputation as a dirty, smelly old fish.\subsection{\-Limitations}\label{group__about_limitations}
libfishsound has been designed to accomodate the various decoding and encoding styles required by a wide variety of software. \-However, as it is an abstraction of the underlying libvorbis, libvorbisenc and libspeex libraries, it may not be possible to implement some low-\/level techniques that these libraries enable, such as parallelization of \-Vorbis sub-\/block decoding. \-Nevertheless it is expected that libfishsound is a useful \-A\-P\-I for most software requiring \-Vorbis or \-Speex support, including most applications the author has encountered.\subsection{\-Acknowledgements}\label{group__about_acknowledgements}
\-Much of the \-A\-P\-I design follows the style of {\tt libsndfile}. \-The author would like to thank \-Erik de \-Castro \-Lopo for feedback on the design of libfishsound.
